<p><em>Hate, is a four letter word. So is love. And sometimes, people can't tell the difference ... Dhurv and Aranya spend a good part of their lives trying to figure out why they want to destroy each other, why they hurt each other so deeply. And, why they can't stay away from each other. The answer is just as difficult each time because all they've wanted is to do the worst, most miserable things to one another. Yet there is something that tells them: THIS IS NOT IT. If you want to know the answer to it all, read the book.</em></p>
