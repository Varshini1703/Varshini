<p><em>I’ve imagined this in my head so many times. I’ve always thought about what I would say; what I would do, and how it would all turn out to be. And every time I would remove some detail . . . She’s a flight attendant—young, bright and living her dream. He’s a heartbroken singer on his way to becoming big. She’s an ardent fan of his. He can’t imagine why and yet seems to find comfort in her words. It’s the first time they are together and in their hearts both are wishing, hoping and praying that the night would never end. That the time they are spending together lasts and lasts... In the world of love, there is always someone perfectly right for you.</em></p>
